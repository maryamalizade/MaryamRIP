Here's a scenario of creating a repository, making commits, creating branches, and merging with and without conflicts will be demonstrated.

The first html file has been published using "Publish" function in matlab as follows:

publish('fact.m','codeToEvaluate','fact(5);')
web('html/fact.html')

A new branch has been created named Dir.

The html file is changed to be commited in Dir branch.
